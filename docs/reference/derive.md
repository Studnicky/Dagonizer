# Derive

Contract-derived flow generation. Ships through `@noocodex/dagonizer/derive`.

```ts
import { DAGDeriver } from '@noocodex/dagonizer/derive';
import type {
  DAGDeriverAnnotations,
  DAGDeriverFanOut,
  DAGDeriverTerminal,
  DAGDeriverOptions,
  OperationContract,
} from '@noocodex/dagonizer/derive';
```

## DAGDeriver

Static class.

```ts
class DAGDeriver {
  static derive(opts: DAGDeriverOptions): DAG;
  static edges(contracts: readonly OperationContract[]): ReadonlyMap<string, ReadonlySet<string>>;
  static depthBuckets(
    contracts: readonly OperationContract[],
    edges: ReadonlyMap<string, ReadonlySet<string>>,
  ): readonly (readonly string[])[];
}
```

### `derive(opts)`

Build a `DAG` from a contract registry plus declared annotations.

```ts
interface DAGDeriverOptions {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly version: string;
  readonly entrypoint: string;
  readonly contracts: readonly OperationContract[];
  readonly annotations?: DAGDeriverAnnotations;
}
```

Operations sharing a topological depth are emitted as a `parallel` placement that fires them concurrently. The `success` route on each linear placement targets the first successor at the next depth. Operations named in `annotations.fanouts.<name>.fanInOperation` are emitted as registered single-node placements (so the `custom` fan-in strategy can resolve them).

Throws `DAGError` when `contracts` is empty.

### `edges(contracts)`

Adjacency map. An entry `A → B` exists iff some path in `A.produces` appears in `B.hardRequired`. Useful for tooling that wants to inspect the data graph before deriving a DAG.

### `depthBuckets(contracts, edges)`

Topological depth buckets. Operations sharing a depth share a bucket. Same data the renderer uses to decide which placements to wrap in a `parallel`.

## DAGDeriverAnnotations

```ts
interface DAGDeriverAnnotations {
  readonly terminals?: Readonly<Record<string, readonly DAGDeriverTerminal[]>>;
  readonly fanouts?:   Readonly<Record<string, DAGDeriverFanOut>>;
  readonly subDAGs?:   Readonly<Record<string, DAGDeriverSubDAG>>;
  readonly parallels?: Readonly<Record<string, DAGDeriverParallel>>;
}

interface DAGDeriverTerminal {
  readonly outcome: string;
  readonly target:  string | null;
}

// Fan-out is a discriminated union over the fan-in strategy.
type DAGDeriverFanOut = {
  readonly source:       string;
  readonly itemKey:      string;
  readonly node:         string;
  readonly concurrency?: number;
  readonly outcomes:     readonly string[];
} & (
  | { readonly strategy: 'custom';    readonly fanInOperation: string }
  | { readonly strategy: 'partition'; readonly partitions:    Readonly<Record<string, string>> }
  | { readonly strategy: 'append';    readonly target:        string }
);

interface DAGDeriverSubDAG {
  readonly dag:           string;
  readonly stateMapping?: {
    readonly input?:  Readonly<Record<string, string>>;
    readonly output?: Readonly<Record<string, string>>;
  };
  readonly outputs:       readonly string[];
}

interface DAGDeriverParallel {
  readonly members:  readonly string[];
  readonly combine:  'all-success' | 'any-success' | 'collect';
}
```

⦿ `terminals` — per-operation alternate exits (route to `null` to terminate, or to a named operation).
⦿ `fanouts` — per-operation fan-out wrapping. `source` is the dotted state-array path; `itemKey` is the metadata key the worker reads; `node` is the per-item registered node; `strategy` discriminates which fan-in shape gets emitted (`custom`+`fanInOperation`, `partition`+`partitions`, or `append`+`target`); `outcomes` lists the fan-out outcome names. Partition keys must appear in `outcomes` — out-of-band keys throw `DAGError` at derive time.
⦿ `subDAGs` — per-operation sub-DAG composition. Swaps the rendered placement from `SingleNode` to `DeepDAGNode` while preserving the contract's role in topology derivation. `dag` is the registered child DAG name; `outputs` is the port set the deep-DAG can route on (auto-wired to the next derived stage, with `terminals` overriding); `stateMapping` is forwarded verbatim to the rendered placement.
⦿ `parallels` — explicit `ParallelNode` grouping with chosen combine strategy. Without it, same-topological-depth operations auto-group with `combine: 'collect'`. With it, the named group forces members into one `ParallelNode` with the consumer's chosen combine. Membership is exclusive across groups.
⦿ An operation cannot appear in more than one of `fanouts` / `subDAGs` / `parallels` — placement kind must be unambiguous.

## OperationContract

```ts
interface OperationContract {
  readonly name:         string;
  readonly hardRequired: readonly string[];
  readonly produces:     readonly string[];
  readonly outputs:      readonly string[];
}
```

Defined in `@noocodex/dagonizer/contracts`; re-exported from `@noocodex/dagonizer/derive` for convenience.

`outputs` declares every port the node can emit. `DAGDeriver` auto-wires each port to the next derived stage; `DAGDeriverAnnotations.terminals[name]` overrides individual ports per-operation. Terminals declaring a port not in the contract's `outputs` throw `DAGError` at derive time.
