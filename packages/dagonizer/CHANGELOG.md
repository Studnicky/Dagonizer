## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 110fef0: v0.10.0 — Plugin architecture per RFC 0001.

  Main package gains three subpaths: `./adapter`, `./patterns`, `./tool`.
  Eight cloud / on-device adapter packages, three external-service tool
  packages, and three pattern packages ship for the first time. The
  Archivist example consumes them all and demonstrates the canonical
  extension pattern.

  Required-with-defaults + V8 shape stability principles enforced
  across every contract surface.
